            <p>Borderlands 2 is a 2012 first-person shooter video game developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K
                Games. Taking place five years following the events of Borderlands
                (2009), the game is once again set on the planet of Pandora. The story follows a new group of Vault
                Hunters who must ally with the Crimson Raiders, a resistance group made
                up of civilian survivors and guerrilla fighters, to defeat the tyrannical Handsome Jack before he can
                unlock the power of a new Vault. The game features the ability to
                explore the in-game world and complete both main missions and optional side quests, either in
                single-player or online cooperative gameplay. Like its predecessor, the game
                features a procedurally generated loot system which is capable of generating numerous combinations of
                weapons and other gear.</p>

            <p>Similar to its predecessor, Borderlands 2 is a first-person shooter with elements drawn from role-playing
                video games. Four playable character classes are available in the
                base game, each with their own unique Action Skill: Axton, "the Commando", can summon a turret to
                provide offensive support. Maya, "the Siren", can "phaselock" enemies by
                trapping them in a sphere of energy for a few seconds. Zer0, "the Assassin", can temporarily become
                invisible and spawn a hologram decoy to distract enemies.
                Salvador, "the Gunzerker", can use his titular ability to temporarily dual-wield weapons. Action Skills
                have a cooldown time during which the player must wait before
                they can use the skill again.</p>

            <p>The game received extremely positive reviews upon release. Critics generally praised the game's visuals,
                story, writing, gameplay, and online multiplayer, while criticising
                its mission design and content fillers. The handheld and the virtual reality versions of the game were
                regarded to be inferior to the console and PC versions. More than 20
                million units were shipped upon release and the game became 2K's most successful release. It was
                nominated for multiple year-end accolades by several gaming publications.
                Gearbox supported the game with four add-on campaigns, new characters and five content packs. The game
                was followed by Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel in 2014 and Borderlands 3
                in 2019.</p>
